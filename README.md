## Overview
This project is an Online Bookstore application developed to demonstrate a complete web development workflow. It showcases the integration of various technologies to build a scalable and user-friendly online book-shopping platform.

## Features
### Front-End Interface: 
Constructed using C#, HTML, and CSS, featuring a book display, forms, and visual elements to provide a seamless user experience.
### Dynamic Functionality: 
Enhanced with JavaScript and AJAX to support dynamic features such as book search, pagination (load more), and CRUD operations (add, delete, update) using a JSON file.
### Back-End API: 
Engineered a robust ASP.NET API with a three-tier architecture to replace direct JSON file access, enabling scalable data retrieval and manipulation through API requests.
### Database Integration: 
Implemented database integration for the API, optimizing data storage and retrieval processes to efficiently manage and display book information and support CRUD operations.
### Modern Architecture: 
Transitioned the project to Angular, developing components, services, and routing for a modern, component-based architecture and improved user experience.

## Usage
Search for Books: Use the search bar to find books by title, author, or genre.
